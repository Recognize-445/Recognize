# Recognize
Recognize is an application which can be used for facial recognition. It includes a server which can listen for images and return a name prediction. This was done as the final project for EECS 445 for the Fall 2015 semester at the University of Michigan.

# Installation
This application requires you to install the following software packages:
<li>1. Matlab</li>
<li>2. MatConvNet</li>
<li>3. Frontalize</li>


# Usage
The code contained in this repository can be used for both training a neural network to learn features of faces and as a server which predicts names based on the previously trained model.

# Client Application
A Google Glass application which makes use of this server can be found [here](https://github.com/kbalouse/RecognizeClient).
